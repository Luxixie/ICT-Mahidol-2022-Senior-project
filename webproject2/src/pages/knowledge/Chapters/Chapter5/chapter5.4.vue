            <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%;color:gray">· High Pre-market Volume: look for premarket volume with at least 500,000 shares.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%;color:gray">· High Relative Volume: look for higher volume spikes than typically traded. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%;color:gray">Traders need to have a routine and system that works for finding stocks with similar setups that they prefer to trade. As I have shown in the video above, having a really good scanner.</p>
            
                
        
            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Find a 1:5 Risk to Reward</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The penny stock sector is filled with manipulators and pumpers. Hence the risk in trading them. Penny stocks are also attractive to traders, especially new ones. They’re cheap to buy and promise big rewards.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">In this case, reading the charts before placing as trade is really important. You may hear people say the charts don’t matter. That is unequivocally not true. Read our post on how to read stock charts for beginners.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The importance of penny stock charts is in the patterns and the technicals. The market is a tug of war between buyers and sellers. This war forms candlesticks patterns.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">These patterns form support and resistance along with the individual candlesticks. Each candlestick by itself also tells a story. Hence the importance of knowing candlesticks.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Candlesticks are the foundation of trading. Without them, technical indicators don’t mean anything. Learning how to read candlesticks and patterns will save you from the manipulators in the penny stock game.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">A penny stock is defined as any stock $5 and under. Although a lot of people think of them cheaper than that. The penny stock charts of the larger dollar amounts are probably going to be the easiest to read.</p>
           


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Candlesticks</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Before you jump into a stock, make sure your risk/reward is high enough. Personally, I’m risk-averse and like a 1:5 ratio — one where your downside risk is $0.05, whereas your upside profit is $0.25.  </p>
            

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">News!</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">There must be some fundamental catalysts for stocks that make them suitable for day trading. News such as earnings reports/surprises/warnings/pre-announcements, FDA approvals/disapproval, mergers/acquisitions, stock splits/buybacks/debt offerings are good examples. We check news daily on Benzinga Pro.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Unusual Premarket Trading Activity</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Typically this means a 2% move up/down premarket. More often than not, this is caused by some news (see above); somethings happening and somebody knows something. Any good scanner will pick up stocks starting to move in the premarket. And if they are to be a stock in play, they must have traded a minimum of 50,000 shares in the premarket with an average daily volume of 500,000 shares. We are updating our gap scanner here daily for the community to find these types of stocks.</p>
          

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">High Volume</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">I’ve talked over and over in previous blog posts about the importance of high volume. To summarize, volume confirms trends, verifies there will be buyers when you want to sell and prevents slippage. Now you’re probably wondering how high is high.</p>      
            <el-row :span="2" class="container" style="margin-top:3%;margin-left:10%">
                    <img src="./images/15.jpg" class="image" />
            </el-row>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">I would say this is a personal preference, but I know some traders won’t trade anything less than a daily volume of 500,000 shares. If you want to get more in depth on volume,  study what does volume mean in stocks.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The relative volume compares the current volume to average volume for the same time of day. To put this in perspective, many stocks trade millions and millions of shares each day, like FB. Does this mean you should trade it? No. It would be best if you looked at more than a high total volume.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">You need to look at what’s normal for that stock and if it’s trading above average. Fifty million shares of FB might be normal, which means you do not want to try to trade it.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">How to Pick Stocks for Day Trading</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Picking stocks for day trading will depend on your trading style. Are you more of a momentum trader or a pattern setup trader? Do you need high volatility or do you want to let the trade setup for a few hours? You can base picking stocks off of your trading style.</p>
            

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Stock Patterns</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Ok, so you found the stocks. Now you need to pick the right ones for YOU. Traders typically follow a routine to do this. That being said, if you want to pick the right stocks for day trading then part of your routine is going to be analyzing the pattern of the stock.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Bullish vs Bearish</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Secondly, you’re going to need to determine if you want to go bullish vs bearish, then search for patterns that are either bullish setups or bearish setups. Personally, I don’t have a preference, and will trade either. If you’re looking for bull plays, you’re going to want to trade bull flags, bull pennants, ascending triangles , and inverse head and shoulders pattern. Preferable all of these patterns are clustered up on your chart to give you a higher probability trade.  </p>
            

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Using a Scanner: How to Find Stocks to Trade</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Luckily you don’t need to prowl the internet looking for stocks to trade; that’s what scanners are for.

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Parting Thoughts</h3>
