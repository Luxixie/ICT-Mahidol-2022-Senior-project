            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Swing trading penny stocks can be a very profitable trading strategy. It involves buying small cap stocks and holding them for weeks up to several months. While this is a very lucrative and popular strategy, it can also be risky if not done right. You need to purchase these stocks at support levels and have the patience to wait awhile before they break out. If you get the wrong entry then you can be waiting awhile for them to break out. Watch our video on how to swing trade penny stocks the right way.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">2. We recommend day trading penny stocks over swing trading</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">3. If you do swing trade them then hold for short term</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">4. Low floaters are volatile and pump and dump</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">5. Mid to high float stocks are safer to swing trade but still risky</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">6. Watch for pullbacks to daily moving average lines</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">7. Look for possible bull flag or reversal setups</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">8. Risk off small candlesticks</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">9. Look to take profits near resistance or when reversals form</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">10. Cut losses quickly</p>



            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Basics of Swing Trading Penny Stocks</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">An issue you may find when trading penny stocks is the large bid ask spread. The bid ask spread is basically telling you the highest price a buyer is willing to go and the lowest a seller is willing to sell.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">When penny stocks are trading at low volume, the spread is typically wide. This can mean a lot of times when you buy at the ask price, you’re immediately in the red, because the spread is so wide and the next buyer may lower his price and the seller may lower his price, chasing the bidder. When volume is low, this is common.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The larger the spread is, the less liquid the stock. When a stock isn’t liquid, it’s not moving as well. What this is telling you is that this particular stock isn’t really being traded and has no volume.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Large bid ask spreads make market orders fill at prices that you don’t necessarily want. Sometimes you may have to swing trade penny stocks without wanting to. Read our post on the difference between market order and limit order.  Look at the volume and bid ask spread before placing a penny stock trade. Otherwise you’re going to feel like this guy waiting for a profit.</p>
            

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Where Can I Find Safe Penny Stocks to Trade?</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Any of the penny stock trading strategies you should employ should revolve around finding good penny stocks. What constitutes a good penny stock? Typically, a popular one, that doesn’t have a massive amount of shares outstanding, has lots of volume. Also it should have good, improving fundamentals. Also the chart should have a long term or medium term up trend. You don’t want to buy a penny stock that is being run into the ground on a stock chart.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Take a look at the chart below:</p>
             <el-row :span="2" class="container" style="margin-top:3%;margin-left:10%">
                    <img src="./images/17.jpg" class="image" />
            </el-row>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Here is a good example of a bearish penny stock that you would NOT want to trade. Long term monthly down trend, And they are also going into bankruptcy. Pay attention to news, earnings, guidance, and other forward looking catalysts that could hurt your swing trade..</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Since penny stocks trade so cheaply you can buy large quantities of them. But that doesn’t always mean you should by more. When you hear someone building a strategy around how many shares they can own and how rich they will be when it goes back to a dollar – that should be a red flag.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">If you’re swing trading penny stocks then looking at the stocks that trade above a dollar may be the safest bet to get a profit. Find a place you trust if you’re looking for penny stock recommendations. You can always ask us in our trade room what we think. Someone will always be there to answer you and look at the chart. </p>
            

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Do Your Own DD and Don’t Fall Into the Traps!</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Never ever take someone’s word about a stock. Always do your own research before ever placing a trade. Just because someone is promising or expecting a huge return doesn’t mean its going to happen.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">If a story sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Look for a respectable trading company if you’re looking for watch lists or data. Newsletters and mailing lists are the breeding grounds of manipulators and pumpers, typically.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">You can always subscribe to the Bullish Bears daily watch lists sent out each night. There’s a good mix of stocks under $5 as well as over $5. They’re stocks that are about to break out of patterns. As a result, this makes for good set ups to trade.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">These are typically short term day trades or swing trades, not buy and holds. Trading is very different than investing and you should be aware of the differences. We never hold these stocks after their momentum has left. It’s just too risky.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Watch out for the Pump and Dump</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Did you know that the penny stock sector has more selling than buying happening? This is because there are people who are paid by companies to pump their stocks for them. It’s not illegal, but they do it anyways. </p>      
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">These manipulators aren’t making money by trading the stocks they’re trying to get you to buy. Instead they make their money from being paid to get you to place the trade. They get paid to advertise the stock.</p>      
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">That’s not to say you can’t make money from a pump and dump scheme. In fact, if you’re well aware of what it is you can take advantage. A typical pump and dump is usually a 2 to 3 day pump followed by a dump. In the penny stock trading industry, this is known as the three day rule…after 3 days..sometimes 4..there is a big dump of profit taking. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">This isn’t the case 100% of the time, although, it is the most common pattern. What is swing trading? It’s holding a stock overnight up to a couple weeks. Sometimes longer, as long as you’re in the green.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">If you’re swing trading penny stocks that are clear pump and dumps, then holding overnight may be possible. However, it’s also super risky. Set a stop loss so if it does drop, you’re not out a lot of money and not becoming a huge bag holder.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Look for Patterns When Swing Trading Penny Stocks</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Swing trading penny stocks is going to require patterns. The charts don’t lie. If someone is telling you that a stock or sector doesn’t follow the charts, then run the other way. Especially if you don’t have proper stock training.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The charts confirm pump and dumps. Head and shoulders patterns are a popular pattern to look for. Why? Because it’s known as the F you pattern. Which is what happens if you get caught at the end of it’s formation.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The importance of patterns, volume and the bid ask spread is going to your saving grace when swing trading penny stocks. Only trade the best set ups. Don’t listen to the advice of other people without doing your due diligence.</p>
