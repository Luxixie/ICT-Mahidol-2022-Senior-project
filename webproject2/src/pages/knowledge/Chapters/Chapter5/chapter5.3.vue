            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Basics of Penny Stock Charts</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The penny stock sector is filled with manipulators and pumpers. Hence the risk in trading them. Penny stocks are also attractive to traders, especially new ones. They’re cheap to buy and promise big rewards.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">In this case, reading the charts before placing as trade is really important. You may hear people say the charts don’t matter. That is unequivocally not true. Read our post on how to read stock charts for beginners.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The importance of penny stock charts is in the patterns and the technicals. The market is a tug of war between buyers and sellers. This war forms candlesticks patterns.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">These patterns form support and resistance along with the individual candlesticks. Each candlestick by itself also tells a story. Hence the importance of knowing candlesticks.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Candlesticks are the foundation of trading. Without them, technical indicators don’t mean anything. Learning how to read candlesticks and patterns will save you from the manipulators in the penny stock game.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">A penny stock is defined as any stock $5 and under. Although a lot of people think of them cheaper than that. The penny stock charts of the larger dollar amounts are probably going to be the easiest to read.</p>
           


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Candlesticks</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Penny stock charts are made up of candlesticks. Each candlestick tells a story as well as form support and resistance. Bullish candlesticks and bearish candlesticks are easy to understand. Price is going up or going down.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">What about doji candlesticks? Those show indecision. There’s also different kinds of doji candles that can give you different information. If you saw a doji forming on the daily chart of a penny stock, how would you trade it?</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The real bodies and wicks of candlesticks form key levels of support and resistance. Support and resistance is another foundational aspect of trading.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">They are levels every single trader pays attention to. If someone is telling you it doesn’t matter in penny stocks, you should take a good hard look as to why they’re saying that.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Does Technical Analysis Work With Penny Stocks?</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Technical analysis absolutely works with penny stocks. In fact, it’s the best way to trade penny stocks. Fundamental analysis is tricky with penny stocks because they company financials usually aren’t good. Knowing how to read candlestick patterns and technical analysis is the key to success.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">The Patterns</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Candlesticks group together to form patterns. Patterns give direction, whether continuation for reversal. For instance, someone is telling you to buy XYZ stock because it’s going to the moon but there are clear head and shoulders patterns.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">That is known as an F you pattern and for good reason. You’re probably about to lose your money if you take that trade. Patterns are a safe guard against pumpers and manipulators.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Penny stock trading strategies should include trading patterns. The penny stock charts don’t lie. Whenever someone tells you a stock is going to the moon, look at the charts.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Who wouldn’t want to get on the ground floor of something big and make a ton of money? Everyone would but how realistic is it? Not very.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Trade the patterns and you’ll save your brokerage account. Take our candlesticks reversals course to learn how to read candles and patterns.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">You can use technical analysis to trade penny stock charts in conjunction with candlesticks and patterns. Moving average crossovers can give you buy and sell signals as well as acting as support and resistance.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Moving average lines provide equilibrium to stocks. If price moves away from them, they’re going to come back. Use them as guides to get into a trade. The closer price is to the moving average at the entry of a trade, the better.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">High Volume</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">I’ve talked over and over in previous blog posts about the importance of high volume. To summarize, volume confirms trends, verifies there will be buyers when you want to sell and prevents slippage. Now you’re probably wondering how high is high.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">I would say this is a personal preference, but I know some traders won’t trade anything less than a daily volume of 500,000 shares. If you want to get more in depth on volume,  study what does volume mean in stocks.</p>


            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Why Penny Stock Charts Matter</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Everything else you’ve read up to this point proves why penny stock charts matter. The sector is manipulated and pumped. Never listen to the success story of someone else.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">In the penny stock sector there are a lot of success stories of how people became millionaires. That may be true but that is the exception not the norm.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">If you get into penny stock trading to get rich quick then you’re probably going to fail. Trading is hard and takes time, practice and stock market training. Penny stock charts are there to be your guide.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Then you’re not getting caught up in the success story of someone else. You’re trading smart and that is a success story in and of itself.</p>
