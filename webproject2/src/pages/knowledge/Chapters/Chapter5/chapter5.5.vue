            <h2 style="margin-left: 3%;  margin-top:2%">Concept</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Knowing how to draw support and resistance levels is fundamental to any traders success. Without having this skillset, how do you know where to buy low and sell high? You don’t if you can’t identify the highs and lows. The whole concept behind trading stocks is to buy low and sell high. In technical terms that means to buy at support levels and sell at resistance levels. So how do you draw support and resistance levels properly? Keep reading and we’ll show you how!</p>
            
                
        
            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">How to Draw Support and Resistance Levels</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">For starters, you want to find as many horizontal peaks and valleys on a chart and connect them with a line. The diagonal peaks and valleys can be higher highs, lower lows, lower highs, higher lows. We refer to these connections as trend lines. In particular, peak levels are called resistance levels and valleys are support levels. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Where it all starts!</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Learning how to draw support and resistance levels is key to becoming a successful trader. There is a small learning curve with learning a new skill like how to draw S&R. We wish that there was an easier way. However, this takes a lot of practice which entails studying hundreds, of charts over the course of several months.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Trading takes hard work and there’s no easy path to success. However, with each day you’ll get better and soon it will become instinctual and automatic. I can say after 2 years of intense trading I can draw support and resistance on the fly in about 20 seconds, even while day trading.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Drawing resistance and support lines is like those “Magic Eye” pictures. Remember…those pictures that drove you nuts trying to see the picture inside of the picture?!?! You had to adjust your eyes to see the picture clearly.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Well…it’s kinda like that. In fact, Dan has a magic eye and loves to draw S&R trend lines to find entries and exits into trades. As a result, we highly recommend you watch Dan’s new video on how to draw support and resistance levels here.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Dan is big on finding “angular momentum” and horizontal resistance to place his trades. </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">Here’s how you determine powerful support and resistance:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">1. Find as many previous highs and lows as possible on a chart. The more you find the stronger the floors and ceilings</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">2. Watch for buying and selling pressure at these levels</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">3. The more buying and selling volume the more powerful the support and resistance</p>

            <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;  margin-top:1%">What Is The Best Charting Software?</h3>

If you’re looking to do day trading then we highly recommend using TOS to chart.</p>
